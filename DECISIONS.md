# Decisions

Deviations from `docs/plan.md` and choices the spec leaves open. One entry per decision, newest last.

## 2026-09-24 — npm workspaces instead of pnpm

Spec §5 says pnpm workspaces; the project owner chose npm. npm workspaces cover what we need (`packages/*`, `eval`).

## 2026-09-24 — Spec §13 answered by project owner

Brands included (flagged), outline only (no filled), no model download in the browser (composable core plus server, browser and local-full compositions), and a lettered glyph fallback. The spec was updated to match (§2, §6.1, §7.0–§7.7, §11.1, §13).

## 2026-09-24 — Autonomous-loop verification setup

Added the eval dev/test split, the two test tiers, per-milestone acceptance criteria + audits, and guard hooks (commit gate on `npm run check`, protected spec/eval files). This lets the loop run lights-out without tuning on its own report set or committing red.

## 2026-09-24 — M3 is a soft checkpoint

Owner decision. After M3 the loop writes the checkpoint report, notifies, and continues. Items that tune on or report eval numbers are tagged `WAITS: eval/REVIEWED` and skipped until the owner reviews the eval set, so unattended runs don't idle and no tuning happens on unreviewed labels.

## 2026-09-24 — Test infrastructure layout

Shared test helpers live in root `test-support/` (type-checked via the root `tsconfig.json`, not published): `tiers.ts` (`describeSlow`/`itSlow`, enabled only by `ICONMATCH_SLOW_TESTS=1`), `fake-embedder.ts` and `fixtures.ts`. Committed fixtures go under root `fixtures/` (`tabler-200/`, `ollama/`, `reference-vectors/`; see `fixtures/README.md`). The fake embedder hashes tokens (FNV-1a) into signed dims and L2-normalises, so shared words raise cosine; it records calls so later tests can prove when the model is (not) invoked. `Embedder` (spec §7.1) is defined now in `packages/core/src/types.ts` for it to implement. Slow tier raises vitest timeouts to 10 min for model downloads.
